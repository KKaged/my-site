        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
        <br />
        I'm
        <span className="font-bold"> Daniel Higareda Leon</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        In February 2023, I began my journey in front-end development, quickly
        developing a passion for crafting engaging web experiences. Based in
        Yokohama, Japan, my dedication to technology drives me towards
        continuous learning and improvement.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, I value time with family and friends, enjoy watching
        Formula 1, going for walks and finding peace in maintaining marine fish
        tanks. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my front-end skills while
        aiming for full-stack development, motivated by a desire to create
        impactful digital solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        When not coding, I'm likely with loved ones or pursuing hobbies, each
        enriching my creativity and shaping me as a versatile developer.
